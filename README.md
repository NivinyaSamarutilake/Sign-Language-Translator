# Sign-Language-Translator
Semester 5 project for CS3282

## Overview
Communication between a speech impaired person and a normal person can be difficult if the latter does not have enough knowledge about sign language. Most of the general population lacks sign language communication skills. A third party is needed for the translation from sign language to verbal language in these situations. Therefore, it is important to develop a mechanism for direct communication between the deaf/mute community and the general population.

The sign language translator app is a solution to the above problem scenario. It is a real-time translator app that uses an image-classification model to differentiate and identify the various hand signs. The images will be captured by the smartphone, and they will be fed into a trained model which will output the corresponding letter as text. This app will translate the ASL alphabet into English.
